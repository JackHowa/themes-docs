## Arc-specific Words 

- PageBuilder Editor is a visual webpage creator. The Editor enables content selection and some visual customization out of the box for non-technical users.
- PageBuilder Engine is a rendering engine built for Editor.
- A Block is a unit to build a website with Editor. Blocks are wrappers for Engine- and Editor-specific functionality. There are two kinds of blocks: Themes Blocks and Custom Blocks.
- Themes Blocks support our core tenet of some customization out of the box. For example, there is an Editor option for hiding or showing an image in a Medium Promo Block.
- Custom Blocks support our core tenet of developer composability. For example, a developer on a client team can implement functionality that is not supported by a Themes Block like a podcast player.
