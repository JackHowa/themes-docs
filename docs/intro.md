## Arc-specific Words 

- PageBuilder Editor is a visual webpage creator. The editor enables content selection and some visual customization out of the box for non-technical users.
- PageBuilder Engine is a custom rendering engine. The engine uses choices made by the editor. 
- A block is a unit to build a website. There are Arc Themes Blocks that support our core tenet of some customization out of the box. Client developers can also develop custom blocks to support specific needs. This ability to create your own blocks supports the core tenet of composability.
